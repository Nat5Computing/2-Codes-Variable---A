# 🎯 Activity: Variables in Python

This activity helps you learn how variables work — and what happens when you break the rules!

## ✅ Task Steps

1. Run the program to see what it does.
2. Change the values of each variable.
3. Try breaking the rules **one at a time** to see what errors appear.
4. Fix the error and explain what you learned!

## 🚫 Rules to Break On Purpose

Try each of these:
- ❌ Change a variable name (e.g. `favouriteApp` → `favApp`) without updating it everywhere
- ❌ Insert a space into a variable name (e.g. `favourite App`)
- ❌ Start a variable name with a digit (e.g. `1vote = True`)
- ❌ Use the wrong case (e.g. `FavouriteApp` instead of `favouriteApp`)
- ❌ Miss out the quotation marks or forget `str()` in a `print()`

## 💬 What to Do

When you get an error:
- Read it carefully
- Try to work out what went wrong
- Ask a partner or teacher if you're stuck!

🎉 Have fun — and remember: errors are how you learn!
